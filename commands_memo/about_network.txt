# The aim of this memo is to have in one place some useful commands about network
#	by Erwan 'Labynocle' Ben Souiden


# run a distant tcpdump and watch locally the result in a wireshark (via ssh)
#	given by a colleague
ssh $USER@$HOST sudo tcpdump -pni $INTERFACE -s0 -w - port $PORT  | wireshark -k -i -

# find remote MAC addresses
arp-scan 192.168.200.0/24

# scan with ping his network
nmap -sP A.B.C.*
# check open port on a node
nmap -sS A.B.C.D

# some info about the TCP connections
netstat -an|awk '/tcp/ {print $6}'|sort|uniq -c

# monitor ping on eth0
tcpdump -pni eth0 icmp

# curl to know your public IP
curl ipecho.net/plain

# find an IP according to the MAC address
fping -c 1 -g -q 10.0.0.0/16
arp -n | grep -i "AA:BB:11:DD:22:44"
